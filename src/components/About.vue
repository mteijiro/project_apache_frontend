        <p>This app was developed for the purpose of collecting data on noise disturbances throughout the city of
          Copenhagen. Each complaint submitted through this app will be entered into a database that will help create
          a deeper understanding of the nightlife noise problem in Copenhagen. We hope that the data collected by this
          app will help raise awareness of the nightlife noise problem, and provide evidence to promote changes in the
          way that noise complaints are handled.</p>
